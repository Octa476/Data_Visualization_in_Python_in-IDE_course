# Data_Visualization_in_Python_in-IDE_course

In this course you will learn how to create a single bar chart showing the number of games per 4 specific gaming platforms(PS4, XOne, PC and WiiU) by game genre using python3.

## The course is structured in 5 parts:

1. Reading a .csv file using pandas.

2. Eliminate the unnecessary rows from the data.

3. Sort data after a field.

4. Create and show a bar chart using matplotlib.

5. Use all the above steps to create your own bar chart with all the specifications.

## Setting up the environment

You need to have Python 3.9+ installed on your machine to complete the course.
If you are not familiar with python3 these are some usefull tips:
- python is an interpreted language(its code is run at runtime line by line)
- you can run a python script by typing in the terminal: 
    On Linux:
    
    ```bash
    python3 "example.py"
    ```
    
    On Windows:
    
    ```bash
    python "example.py"
    ```

1. Open your terminal(cmd, bash, etc) and clone the repository:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Octa476/Data_Visualization_in_Python_in-IDE_course.git
```

2. Install all dependencies using pip:

```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Enter the project's folder:
```bash
    cd Data_Visualization_in_Python_in-IDE_course
```

Your environment is all set up now and you can start the course.

## Start learning

You will find 5 separate folders each for every step in the course. Complete every step in the given
order. The Step1 to Step4 folders contain all the learning materials necessary to create a bar chart with those
specifications and the final folder Step5 let you create your own bar chart.
Every step is covered with tests that help you improve your skills for the given task you need to complete.
